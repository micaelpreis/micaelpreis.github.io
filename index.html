                    Hi, my name is <strong>{{ site.author.name }}</strong> and I'm a Software Engineer from Portugal.
    				<br><br>
                    I just finished my M.Sc Degree in Software Engineering at <a href="http://www.uc.pt/en">University of Coimbra</a> in Portugal, and I'm currently working as a Junior Web Developer at <a href="https://bannerwise.io/">Bannerwise</a> in Amsterdam.
    				<br><br>
    				I love programming and to learn new things, specially when it comes to my big passion, web development. My hobbies go from listen and playing music, to watch movies and series and doing all kind of sports.
