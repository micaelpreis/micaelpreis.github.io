        <title>Hello! Welcome To My Blog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello there, my name is Micael Reis, Iâ€™m a software engineer from Portugal and I would like to welcome you to my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/cE02lboc8JPO/giphy.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Hello there&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long time ago I had this idea of creating a website where I could showcase my projects and share my experience. Unfortunately, I never got around to do it and as time was going by I started to forget about this idea, until &lt;strong&gt;NOW!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: 200;&quot;&gt;It happened! It finally happened! I created my personal website and blog. YEYYY!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the website will serve as a way to show the projects I have been working in and the volunteer work I have done recently, the goal of this blog is to share the thoughts and experiences that I will encounter during my professional life as a Software Engineer / Web Developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, expect to see a lot of technical posts as well as some personal posts related to my work experience. For the technical posts, I will be more focused on web technologies and frameworks since that is my field of work, but I will not hesitate to write about other cool things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: 200;&quot;&gt;I can't promise I will upload frequently, but I can promise you that I will do my best to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in knowing how I developed this website, I did it with the help of &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and hosted it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. You can check the source code on my GitHub page, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/micaelpreis/micaelpreis.github.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more, BYEE!!!&lt;/p&gt;
