Hello there, my name is Micael Reis, I'm a software engineer from Portugal and I would like to welcome you to my blog.

![Hello there](https://media.giphy.com/media/cE02lboc8JPO/giphy.gif)

A long time ago I had this idea of creating a website where I could showcase my projects and share my experience. Unfortunately, I never got around to do it and as time was going by I started to forget about this idea, until **NOW!!!**

---
<p align="center" style="font-weight: 200;">It happened! It finally happened! I created my personal website and blog. YEYYY!</p>
---

While the website will serve as a way to show the projects I have been working in and the volunteer work I have done recently, the goal of this blog is to share the thoughts and experiences that I will encounter during my professional life as a Software Engineer / Web Developer.

In this blog, expect to see a lot of technical posts as well as some personal posts related to my work experience. For the technical posts, I will be more focused on web technologies and frameworks since that is my field of work, but I will not hesitate to write about other cool things.

<p align="center" style="font-weight: 200;">I can't promise I will upload frequently, but I can promise you that I will do my best to do it.</p>

If you are interested in knowing how I developed this website, I did it with the help of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and hosted it on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. You can check the source code on my GitHub page, <a href="https://github.com/micaelpreis/micaelpreis.github.io" target="_blank">here</a>.

Stay tuned for more, BYEE!!!
